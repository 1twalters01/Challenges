Function that adds digits together:
    pass in the number in question
    get a variable called summation equal to 0
    while number >0:
        summation = summation + number%10
        number = number // 10
    
factorial function:
    factorial = 1
    for loop between 1 and the number:
        factorial = factorial * i
