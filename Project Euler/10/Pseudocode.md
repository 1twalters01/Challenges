# Problem 10 - Summation of primes
## Too slow
have a variable equal to 0
for loop from 2 to 2 million
    check if it is prime or not
    if it is then add it on

##
Create a variable for the summation
Generate a bool list with 2 million entries equal to true
for all numbers in range 2 to 2 million:
    if sieve at that point is equal to true
        add the number to the sum
