# Problem 56 - Powerful digit sum
## O(n^2)
Create a function that sums digits:
    variable = 0
    while number is not 0:
        variable = variable + number%10
        number = number //10
    return the variable

set max_number = 0
create a function with two loops that puts a^b into the created function
if the return variable is bigger than max_number set max_number to be it
