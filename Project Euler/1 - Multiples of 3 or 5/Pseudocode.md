# Multiples of 3 or 5
## Problem 1
### O(1)
Using sum of n terms equation to get the sum -> Sum = n(n+1)/2:

To get the sum of multiples of x up to n we must thus:
divide n by x and round down
do the equation and then multiply by x

Do this for 3, 5 and 15. Then sum the answers for 3 and 5, and then subtract the answer for 15.
