# Problem 4 - Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Combine the lists into a singular list
Sort the list
Get the length of the array
if it is an odd number of values:
    add 1 and then divide by 2 to get the index
    get the value from the medium index
if it is an even number of values:
    divide by 2
    add 1 divide by 2 and save it
    get the values of these two numbers
    add them together and divide by 2
